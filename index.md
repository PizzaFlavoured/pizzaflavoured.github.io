# Hey there!

For *now*, there isn't much here. I plan on making this place all nice and cosy, and then add more information about me but, for now, I'll only write the basics.

### Me

I do programming as an hobby as it's pretty enjoyable. I also start a lot of projects and never finish them, so there's that. *Exciting*, wouldn't you say?

Feel free to check my repositories out!
